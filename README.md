# DAY 1 after the Farewell

** Here I'm again with my tears :)
** Do you know 'Happy tragedy' by Saint Asonia? I often associate it with me.
Actually even 1 day didn't last after my farewell so I almost did nothing.
I decided to write my main principles here which I usually try to remember in my tough moments.

1. Follow all moral principles (don't kill, cheat etc)
2. Remember that action precedes motivation.
3. You're your best friend.
4. It's better to regret what you've done than what you haven't done.
5. Don't make decisions in emotions.
6. The best revenge is the hardest work on yourself.
7. Thoughts are real, you should control them.
8. Don't try to make someone back who once cheated on you. They will do it again.
9. If you cheated on someone, you should be clear about that.
10. It's better to make others hate you for you being you than make them love you for your hypocrisy.
11. Your partner is the closest person in the world after yourself.
12. Love is to choose the same person everyday regardless.
13. If there is the choice between your principles and benefit, choose the first one. That what makes you you.
14. All lives are important, no matter whom they belong to.

I don't remember all of them, I think the list will get longer soon.
The hardest principle is to remember the second one.
